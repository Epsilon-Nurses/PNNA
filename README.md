## Philippines Nursing Association (Approved by Jacob)  
* Summary of idea.
  * Concept: During the time of the pandemic our group would like to give back to our community front line medical worker. Recent data has shown that as the spread of covid-19 rises we as a nation are falling short on the necessary medical staff needed to combat this pandemic. Statistics showed that most hospital workers come from the nation of the Philippines. We have partnered up with the President Elect of the Philippines Nursing Association of Central California to produce a website to help nurses find a community
  * Goals: Create a network for immigrating nurses from the Philippines to receive, share, and communicate available resources. 
* What problem or pain point does it solve? a. Keep it high level without going into too much detail. (3-4 sentences is enough)
  * Helps immigrating nurses to find resources in the states as well as keep in touch with fellow immigrants.
* Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition. What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?
  * Homepage with registration form
    * Basic information collected on form
    * Ideally have cultural/city specific connections between members to make sure they can get in touch with people from similar backgrounds. 
  * Resource page (Stretch Goal: add calendar with events)
    * Possible Event Lumpia Making Fundraiser
    * Social Media Account
